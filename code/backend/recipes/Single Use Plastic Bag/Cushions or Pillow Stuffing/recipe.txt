1. Collect and Prepare Plastic Bags: 
- Gather clean and dry plastic bags. Flatten them and remove any handles, stickers, or hard parts. Ensure the bags are clean and free from moisture to prevent mold or odor.
2. Design and Cut Fabric: 
- Measure and cut the fabric for the cushion or pillow cover according to the desired size. Leave an opening on one side or edge for later stuffing.
3. Prepare Plastic Bag Stuffing: 
- Start stuffing the cushion or pillow cover with the plastic bags. Crumple the bags loosely or stuff them as compactly as preferred, depending on the desired firmness of the cushion. Keep adding bags until achieving the desired level of fullness.
4. Even Distribution: 
- Distribute the plastic bags evenly throughout the cushion or pillow cover to ensure a uniform feel and shape. Avoid overstuffing, as it may affect the comfort and shape of the cushion.
5. Closing the Opening: 
- Once the cushion or pillow is adequately stuffed, carefully close the opening by sewing it shut using a sewing machine or hand stitching. Ensure the closure is secure to prevent the plastic bags from coming out.
6. Decorative Touch (Optional): 
- If desired, embellish the cushion or pillow with decorative elements such as buttons, embroidery, or other fabric adornments.
7. Finishing and Use: 
- Trim any excess thread and fluff the cushion or pillow to evenly distribute the stuffing. Your upcycled plastic bag cushion or pillow is now ready for use!

Tips:
- For added comfort and softness, consider adding a layer of traditional cushion or pillow stuffing (such as cotton or foam) over the plastic bag stuffing before closing the cover.
- Ensure the plastic bags are clean and free from sharp edges to avoid discomfort while using the cushion or pillow.
