1. Preparation: 
- Select a clean plastic bottle, preferably one with a wide opening, to use as a water dispenser for birds.
2. Making holes: 
- Use a sharp knife or heated nail to create small holes near the bottom of the bottle. These holes should be small enough to prevent rapid water flow but large enough for birds to access the water.
3. Filling with clean water: 
- Fill the bottle with clean water through the top opening. Make sure not to overfill to avoid spillage.
4, Placing the dispenser: 
- Position the bottle with the holes facing downwards in a holder or secure it to a pole, ensuring stability and accessibility for birds to drink from the dispenser.
5. Regular maintenance: 
- Check the bird feeder or water dispenser regularly to refill seeds or water as needed. Clean the dispenser periodically to maintain hygiene.
