1. Preparation: 
- Choose a clean, empty plastic bottle of a suitable size. Larger bottles work well for bird feeders.
2. Cutting the bottle: 
- Using a sharp knife or scissors, carefully cut out holes or windows in the sides of the bottle, leaving enough space for birds to access the seeds. The holes should be large enough for birds to comfortably reach the feed but small enough to prevent spillage.
3. Making perches (optional): 
- Cut small wooden dowels or branches and insert them through the bottle near the feeding holes to create perches for birds to rest while feeding. Secure them firmly.
4. Filling with birdseed: 
- Fill the bottom of the bottle with birdseed through the top opening. Ensure the feeder is filled enough for birds to easily access the seeds.
5. Hanging the feeder: 
- Create a loop using string or wire and secure it around the neck of the bottle. Hang the feeder from a tree branch, hook, or any elevated spot where birds frequent.
