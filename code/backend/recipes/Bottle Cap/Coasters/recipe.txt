1. Prepare the base: 
- Cut cardboard or cork sheet into coaster-sized circles or squares (4 inches by 4 inches is a standard size).
2. Arrange the bottle caps: 
- Use hot glue or strong adhesive to firmly attach the bottle caps, bottoms facing up, onto the cardboard or cork base. Arrange them tightly to cover the entire surface.
3. Secure the caps: 
- Press firmly to ensure the caps are securely attached to the base. Allow the adhesive to dry completely.
4. Optional sealant or resin (if desired): 
- Apply a clear sealant or resin over the bottle caps to provide a smooth and waterproof finish. Follow the instructions on the sealant or resin for application and drying times.
5. Final touches: 
- Trim any excess cardboard or cork around the edges if necessary. Clean the coasters and ensure they're dry before using them.
