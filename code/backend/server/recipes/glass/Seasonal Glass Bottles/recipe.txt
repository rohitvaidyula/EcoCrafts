- Spring: Fill the bottles with artificial grass or moss and add colorful eggs or small decorative chicks. You could also use fresh spring flowers like tulips or daffodils for a vibrant and seasonal display.
- Summer: Embrace the bright and sunny vibes by filling the bottles with sand and small seashells. Add a miniature beach umbrella or palm tree figurines to evoke a beachy feel. You could also incorporate fresh tropical flowers like hibiscus or orchids for a summery touch.
