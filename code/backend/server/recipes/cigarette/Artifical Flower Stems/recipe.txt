- Preparing the filters: 
    - Ensure the cigarette filters are thoroughly cleaned and free from any tobacco residue. You can soak them in warm, soapy water, rinse well, and let them dry completely.
- Creating petals: 
    - Cut out petal shapes from colored paper or fabric. You can choose any flower design you prefer, such as rose, daisy, or any other floral shape. Make several petals of various sizes.
- Assembling the flower: 
    - Apply craft glue or use a hot glue gun to attach the petals around one end of the cleaned cigarette filter. Start with the smaller petals on the inside and layer larger petals on the outside to create a flower shape.
- Shaping the flower: 
    - Gently shape and arrange the petals to give a more natural look to the flower. You can slightly curl the edges of the petals using your fingers for added realism.
- Creating the stem: 
    - If using floral wire or wooden skewers as stems, attach them to the base of the flower using glue. Ensure the stem is securely attached to the flower.
- Covering the stem: 
    - Wrap the stem with green floral tape to give it a realistic appearance. Start from the base of the flower and wrap it downward along the stem, pulling slightly as you go to stretch the tape and activate its adhesive properties.
- Finishing touches: 
    - Once the stem is covered with floral tape, trim any excess and secure the end. Adjust the flower and stem as needed for a finished look.
- Creating a bouquet or arrangement: 
    - Repeat the process to create several flowers with stems. Arrange them together in a vase or gather them to create a bouquet. You can mix different colors and flower types for variety.
