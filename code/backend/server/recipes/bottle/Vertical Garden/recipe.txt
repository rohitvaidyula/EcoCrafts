1. Preparing the bottles: 
- Collect and clean plastic bottles thoroughly. Remove labels, caps, and any residue inside the bottles. Ensure the bottles are dry before proceeding.
2. Cutting the bottles: 
- Using a sharp knife or scissors, cut the bottles horizontally, typically around the middle or slightly higher. Make clean cuts to create two separate parts: the top (with the neck) and the bottom. The bottom part will act as the planter.
3. Creating drainage holes: 
- To avoid waterlogging, create small drainage holes in the bottom of each bottle using a drill or heated nail. This allows excess water to drain out and prevents root rot.
4. Preparing the planters: 
- Fill the bottom halves of the bottles with potting soil, leaving some space at the top. Ensure the soil is loose and well-aerated for proper plant growth.
5. Planting seeds or seedlings: 
- Plant seeds or small seedlings in the soil-filled bottles. Choose plants suitable for the available space and light conditions. Herbs, succulents, and small ornamental plants work well for vertical gardens.
6. Assembling the vertical garden: 
- If planning to hang the bottles, create a hanging system using twine or wire. Securely tie the bottles together or hang them individually in a vertical row.
7. Watering and maintenance: 
- Water the plants gently to avoid displacing the soil. Monitor the moisture levels regularly and water when the soil starts to dry out. Ensure proper sunlight and care according to the specific plant's requirements.
8. Arranging the garden: 
- Arrange the bottles in a pattern or design that suits your space. You can create a wall-mounted structure or hang them from a frame, balcony railing, or on a dedicated vertical gardening structure.
9. Regular care and monitoring: 
- Maintain the vertical garden by regularly checking for pests, providing necessary nutrients, and pruning or trimming plants as needed to encourage healthy growth.
10. Expansion and creativity: 
- Expand your vertical garden by adding more bottles over time. Get creative with the arrangement, colors, and types of plants to create an aesthetically pleasing display.
