- Collect Cartons:
    - Gather cartons of various sizes, such as those from milk, juice, or cereal boxes. The variety in sizes will allow you to create different rooms with distinct functions.
- Clean and Prepare:
    - Ensure the cartons are clean and dry. Remove any labels or adhesive residues to provide a smooth surface for decorating.
- Plan Your Layout:
    - Decide on the layout of your dollhouse. Consider the number of rooms, their sizes, and how you want to arrange them. This could include bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, and bathroom.
- Cutting and Assembling Rooms:
    - Cut the cartons into desired shapes to represent different rooms. Use a larger carton as the main structure and attach smaller cartons as additional rooms or floors. Consider cutting out windows and doors for a more realistic feel.
- Decorate the Walls:
    - Cover the interior walls of each room with decorative materials. This could be fabric, wallpaper, or painted designs. Let your creativity flow as you personalize each room.
- Create Furniture and Decor:
    - Use small toys, craft materials, or other household items to create furniture and decor for each room. For example, bottle caps can become tables, and small pieces of fabric can serve as carpets.
- Personalize Each Room:
    - Add personal touches to each room based on its intended purpose. Consider creating a cozy bedroom with a bed and miniature pillows or a kitchen with a tiny stove and table.
- Connect the Rooms:
    - Attach the rooms together to form the dollhouse structure. You can use glue or double-sided tape to secure the cartons in place, ensuring stability.
- Exterior Decoration:
    - Decorate the exterior of the dollhouse with paint, markers, or additional materials to give it an attractive and cohesive look. Add details like windows, a front door, and a roof.
- Create a Yard (Optional):
    - If space allows, consider extending the dollhouse to include a yard or garden area. Use additional materials like small stones for a pathway or artificial grass for a lawn.
- Personalize with Characters:
    - Introduce small dolls or action figures to inhabit your dollhouse. These characters bring life to the miniature world you've created.
- Display or Play:
    - Once your DIY dollhouse is complete, find a special place to display it or let children engage in imaginative play. It's a wonderful project that encourages creativity and recycling.
