1. Prepare the Straws: 
- Cut plastic straws into equal-sized segments of the desired length. For a basic cube, you'll need twelve straws of the same length.
2. Prepare the Modeling Clay: 
- Take a small amount of modeling clay and roll it into small balls or cubes. These will act as the vertices or connectors where the straws will be inserted.
3. Create the Base: 
- Take four straws and arrange them to form a square on a flat surface. Use the modeling clay balls at each corner of the square to hold the straws in place. Press the ends of the straws firmly into the modeling clay to secure them.
4. Add the Second Layer: 
- Place another four straws on top of the first square to create a second square parallel to the base. Use the modeling clay at the corners to attach these straws, ensuring they align with the bottom square.
5. Connect the Sides: 
- Take the remaining four straws and connect them vertically between the corresponding corners of the two squares. Secure the straws in the modeling clay at both ends to complete the cube shape.
6. Secure and Adjust (if needed): 
- Ensure that all straws are firmly inserted into the modeling clay to hold the structure together. If any connections feel loose, gently press them into the clay for better stability.
7. Check and Reinforce (if necessary): 
- Double-check the cube's stability and adjust any straws or connections that appear loose. Add additional modeling clay if needed to reinforce the joints.
8. Inspect and Display: 
- Once the cube structure is complete and stable, inspect it to ensure all connections are secure. Display your finished cube structure on a stable surface.
