- Collection and drying: 
    - Collect used cigarette butts, remove any remaining tobacco content, and allow them to dry completely. Ensure they are free from any chemicals or additives.
- Soaking cigarette butts: 
    - Once dry, place the cigarette butts in a container and cover them with water. Allow them to soak for a few hours or overnight.
- Straining the solution: 
    - After soaking, strain the water using a fine strainer or cloth to remove the cigarette remnants. This will ensure that only the solution remains without solid particles.
- Transfer to a spray bottle or watering can: 
    - Pour the filtered solution into a spray bottle or watering can, making it easier to apply to your garden plants.
- Application in the garden: 
    - Spray or water the plants with this solution. Focus on areas where pests are likely to be present or where they commonly attack your plants. The strong scent from the cigarette solution might act as a deterrent for pests.
