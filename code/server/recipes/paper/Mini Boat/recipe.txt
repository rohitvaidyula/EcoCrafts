- Start with a square piece of aluminum foil. A 6x6 inch (15x15 cm) square works well for this project.
- Fold the foil in half diagonally to create a triangle.
- Fold the two bottom corners of the triangle up to meet the top corner, creating a smaller triangle.
- Fold the bottom corner of the smaller triangle up to meet the top point, then unfold it to create a crease.
- Open up the last fold slightly to form a small boat-like structure. Press down on the sides to create a flat base.
